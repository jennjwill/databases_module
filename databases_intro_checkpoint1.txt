1. What data types do each of these values represent?

A: I'm answering for primitive data types, but the database might give attributes like "name" or "date."

  1. "A Clockwork Orange" -- string
  2. 42 - integer
  3. 09/02/1945 -- integer (date)
  4. 98.7 -- float 
  5. $15.99 -- integer (price)


2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A: A database would be used when you need to easily search for specific data, when you need that data to persist beyond the end of a program, and when data needs to be manipulated/accessed by different sources at once. It's always there, in storage.

A text file would be used to hold text that a program can access (but without the above needs).


3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

A: SQL is declarative, meaning we tell the databse what we're looking for rather than giving an algorithm for how to find what we're looking for.


4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

A: A database is set up as an application that allows users to manage data though an interface (GUI or command line). The app might be on a server, with another machine as the user getting data.

Data is stored in databases in a binary file format (not readable by humans), allowing for speedy reading & manipulation (by the dbase system).


5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

A: 
Table: a whole set of rows, columns, and data orgazined into a readable line format.

Row: the horizontal rows w/a label and cells holding visually organized data in a table

Column: the vertical columns w/labels and cells holding visually organized data in a table


6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

A: strings, numbers, objects



7. Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:

     SELECT date, amount  //return date, amount
     FROM payments;       //from payments table

     returns: 
     Date         Amount
    5/1/2016      1500.00
    5/10/2016       37.00
    5/15/2016      124.93
    5/23/2016       54.72


     SELECT amount          //return amount
     FROM payments          //from payments table
     WHERE amount > 500;    //only the cells where amount > 500

     returns:
     Amount
     1500.00



     SELECT *                      // "*" selects/returns all of the columns/rows that match the where clause 
     FROM payments                 //from payments table
     WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods'    //only cells with payee of Mega Foods

     returns:
       Date       Payee       Amount      Memo
     5/15/2016   Mega Foods   124.93    Groceries   
     

8. Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria and include the output:

The email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.

SELECT email, sign-up
FROM users
WHERE name = "DeAndre Data";

output:

   email          signup
datad@comcast   2008-01-20


The user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.

SELECT userid
FROM users
WHERE email = "aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu";

output:

 userid
    1


All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.

SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE userid = 4;

output:

userid       name            email                  signup
4         Brandy Boolean   bboolean@nasa.gov       1999-10-15
